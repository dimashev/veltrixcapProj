Home assignment

Hello Team,

Thank you for taking the time to interview me yesterday.
I wanted to follow up as I feel I could have performed better during the technical portion. While I don't want to make excuses, I was somewhat nervous, and it's been quite a while since I've written BASH scripts from scratch. In my day-to-day work, I typically use AI tools to handle syntax details so I can focus on architecture, problem-solving, and rapid delivery.
I'm confident the take-home assignment will better demonstrate my technical capabilities and approach to development. I'm highly committed to delivering quality work, and I'm happy to provide references from my previous managers who can speak to my dedication and skills.
Thank you again for the opportunity.

p.s
I have also fixed my mistakes from the interview we had.

Best regards,
Dima Shevchuk
